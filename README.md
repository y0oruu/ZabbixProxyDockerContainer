# ZabbixProxyDockerContainer
This repo is for creating a docker container with a ZabbixProxy in. The container is installed in WSL.

You have to have WSL and a distro installed on your system.

You can also use the script in "autostart" to start the container at windows startup, without the need to have a user logged in which is very hard to do with docker containers in windows.
To launch the script at windows startup you have to launch it with the task scheduler at each start of your computer.
